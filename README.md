# imdb_database_coursework_in_SQL

This is the 2nd Coursework for F28DM Database Management Systems, 2nd year of Bsc Computer Science.

This is a coursework where we play with the database from IMDB. This is my solution to it. 

The source code for this program has been encrypted in sqlCoursework.zip due to the coursework being still used.
